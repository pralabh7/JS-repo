js is a single threaded language.
For execution, firstly global execution context is created and allocated in 'this'.different for diff environments like browser, nodejs,etc.
Execution contexts-GEC, Functional EC and Eval EC.
Execution in two phases now- Memory creation phase(or Creation phase) and Execution phase.
memory phase-memory allocated for variables with value as undefined.
execution phase-value allocated to variables and new execution context is made for function execution with new variable environment and execution thread.
then again memory phase and execution phase for new execution context.
value is returned to GLOBAL execution context then execution context is deleted

Call stack- functions execution by storing in stack.
bottom of stack-GEC
LIFO is followed
